.. NOTE::
    It is recommended that RMG be installed with Python 2.7, although it has been previously tested that Python 2.5 and 2.6 may also work. Dependency issues render it incompatible with Python 3.x releases.


Recommended: Installation Using Anaconda
========================================

It is highly recommended to use the Python platform Anaconda to perform the installation of RMG-Py.
Currently, this installation method is available only for unix-based systems: Linux and MacOSX.
