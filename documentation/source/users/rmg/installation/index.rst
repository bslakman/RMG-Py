Installation

.. NOTE::
    It is recommended that RMG be installed with Python 2.7, although it has been previously tested that Python 2.5 and 2.6 may also work. Dependency issues render it incompatible with Python 3.x releases.

    

For Basic Users: Binary Installation Using Anaconda
===================================================

It is highly recommended to use the Python platform Anaconda to perform the installation of RMG-Py.
A binary installation is recommended for users who want to use RMG out of the box, and are
not interested in changing or recompiling the RMG code or making many additions to 
RMG's thermodynamic and kinetics databases.

For Developers: Installation by Source Using Anaconda Environment
=================================================================

RMG-Py can now be built by source using the Anaconda Python Platform to assist in installing
all necessary dependencies. This is recommended for a developer who may be altering the RMG source code
or someone who expects to manipulate the databases extensively.  You will also be able to access the latest
source code updates and patches through Github.
